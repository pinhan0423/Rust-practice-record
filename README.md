# 🦀 Rust Leetcode Solutions

This repository contains my personal practice solutions to Leetcode problems written in **Rust**.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and the Rust programming language by solving real-world problems.

Each problem is organized as a standalone project using `cargo new` for clarity and easy execution.
